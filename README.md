# sql
A collection of queries I have written in various professional and educational projects, where proprietary info has been scrubbed from the files.

This code is collected from the period of 2018-now

**Purpose**: this repository is a porfolio of my work, satisfying the following objectives:

- A method to collect my queries for reuse in future projects
- An open source of queries for others to use as needed, per GNU GPL
- Proven expertise of query development for future employment and teaching purposes
